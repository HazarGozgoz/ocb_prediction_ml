# OCB Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the Python code for the study titled "An Artificial Intelligence Model for Predicting Oligoclonal Band Positivity".

This script performs a comprehensive comparison of six different machine learning models for predicting OCB status based on routine laboratory data, using a 5-fold cross-validation methodology.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need Python 3.x and the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
